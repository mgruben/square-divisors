# square-divisors
Finds all the numbers in a given range whose divisors, when squared, sum to a perfect square.

For example:
```
(1, 500) -> {{1, 1}, {42, 2500}, {246, 84100}, {287, 84100}}
```
This project was completed for [CodeWars - Integers: Recreation One](https://www.codewars.com/kata/integers-recreation-one/cpp).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
